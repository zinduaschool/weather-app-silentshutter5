# Weather-App

Build a weather application that fetches weather data from an API asynchronously and displays it to the user.
The application should have the following features:

- A form where the user can input a city or zip code to get the weather for that location.
- Use the Fetch API or AJAX calls to fetch the weather data asynchronously from a weather API.
- Display the weather information on the screen, including the temperature, conditions, and any other relevant data.
- Handle errors gracefully, such as when the user enters an invalid location or there is an issue with the API call.
- Implement a loading indicator to let the user know when the data is being fetched.

For an additional challenge, you could also include a feature to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units for the temperature display.
